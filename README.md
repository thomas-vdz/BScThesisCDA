# Exploring the feasibiliy of arbitrage in the scarf economy
The entire script was built from scratch for my Bachelor Thesis for Econometrics at the University of Amsterdam

The system features an exchange which can connect buyers and sellers of goods by Continous Double Auction.
The environment mimics the experimental setup of Anderson et. al. (2014).


The abstract of my thesis is:
The literature on financial trading agents is primarily focused on trading performance,
and not necessarily on arbitrage. The experiments of Anderson et al. (2004) have shown that
human traders engage in arbitrage. This paper aims to test if arbitrage is a viable strategy for
trading agents in the Scarf economy. We will propose modifications to the eGD algorithm
to test the profitability of an arbitrage strategy in the stable version of the Scarf economy.
Results have shown that we were able to create a trading agent which could consistently
make arbitrage profits. The trading agents were not able to gain extra utility from these
arbitrage profits as they did not amount to enough extra capital.

For people interested reading my thesis I have included it in the repository.
